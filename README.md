# Rude Blackjack
Welcome to my virtual casino!

Type "`python3 blackjack.py`" into the command line to play!

You'll be playing against Dave, the world's first sassy, card-dealing, foul-mouthed, self-aware (not really), and all around unpleasant AI!

Choose how many decks to use and get going! (It's great practice for counting cards, but don't tell anyone)

![gameplay](screenshots/gameplay.png)

Sometimes you'll win!

But mostly you'll probably lose...

So get out there and be the card shark your mother always wanted you to be!
